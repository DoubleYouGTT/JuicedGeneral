The package has been in use for personal and work-related projects for many years. It might not be perfect, and it "forces" the loading of a lot of other packages on you. But that allowed me to easily work and develop other applications.

If you find any use for it, I'm happy - and feel free to simply extract one or more functions for your own use!

## Function overview 

The package is divided into various function families. You will be able to find functions related to:
- Conversion
- Data
- Data.table
- Date and time
- File handling
- Generic functions
- Interactivity and plotting (plotly)
- Lists
- Loading libraries and source files automatically
- Math
- Strings
- Vectors

A full list of all functions and their parameters can be found in the "[JuicedGeneral.pdf](JuicedGeneral.pdf)" file.
